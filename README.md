## Installation:
1. Install Python from the Python website/update it to the latest version
2. run `pip install opencv-python`
3. run `pip install PyQt5`
4. run `pip install matplotlib`

## Instructions for Use:
1. Run `python3 main.py`
2. A display window with GUI should pop up. If you run into an error here, make sure you update Python and all the libraries to their latest version.
