## Image Operation Visualizer
Tool to visualize various matrix and element-wise operations on images. Created for Cristian Rodriguez's Fall 2022 MATH235 Linear Algebra class.

## Installation:
1. Install Python from the Python website/update it to the latest version
2. run `pip install opencv-python`
3. run `pip install PyQt5`
4. run `pip install matplotlib`
5. Install a basic LaTeX distribution from https://www.latex-project.org/get/ (You do not need TeX Live or any editor!). Get the simplest distro you can that includes TeX
6. Install CM-Super on MacOS using `sudo tlmgr update --self` and `sudo tlmgr install cm-super`

## Instructions for Use:
1. Run `python3 main.py`
2. A display window with GUI should pop up. If you run into an error here, make sure you update Python and all the libraries to their latest version.
2. If you wish to modify the images used, replace `image.png` and `overlay.png` in the root folder
